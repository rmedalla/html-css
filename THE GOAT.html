        <p class="whitey">James Edward Harden Jr. (born August 26, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
            Harden played college basketball for Arizona State, where he was named a consensus All-American and Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2009. Harden was selected with the third overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. 
            In 2012, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year with the Thunder and helped the team reach the NBA Finals.
            Harden was traded to Houston prior to the 2012–13 NBA season. Upon joining the Rockets, Harden became one of the NBA's most prolific scorers and earned recognition as the best shooting guard in the NBA, 
            as well as one of the top overall players in the league.[4] He has earned All-Star nods six times, and has earned All-NBA Team honors four times as well – once to the All-NBA Third Team (2013) and three times to the All-NBA First Team (2014, 2015 and 2017). 
            In 2015, Harden was named MVP at the National Basketball Players Association's first annual Players Awards, being voted by his peers as the league's most valuable player.
            Harden is a two-time member of the United States national basketball team, winning gold medals in both the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2014 FIBA World Cup.</p>
